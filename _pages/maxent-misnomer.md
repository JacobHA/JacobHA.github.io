tl;dr:
The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle is a special case of the entropy-regularized RL setting when the prior policy is taken to be uniform.
Unfortunately, the term "MaxEnt" is often used to refer to the entropy-regularized RL setting in general, which can be misleading. Sometimes many "MaxEnt" results do in fact carry over to the more general setting (of an arbitrary prior policy), but care is needed to ensure that the results are not specific to the uniform prior policy.

Perhaps "entropy-regularized" will get a nice nickname some day, but "EntReg" (entrails?) does not sound very appealing. Maybe "EntRized", "EntRe", ...
