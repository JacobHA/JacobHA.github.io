tl;dr:
I had a great time attending AAAI-2023 in Washington, D.C. I met many great people and learned a lot about the broader AI community. I attended all of the "RL Theory" and "RL Algorithms" sessions to find out more about the RL community's interests. Please find the full paper (arXiv version) at this link: [Utilizing Prior Solutions for Reward Shaping and Composition in Entropy-Regularized Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01174). The poster is here: [Poster (pdf)](/assets/poster-aaai23-resized.pdfz).

## The Details:
Many folks working on RL theory are interested in the bandit setting which was a bit surprising to me. On the algorithms side, there were a few other groups working on reward-shaping and methods for transfer learning and hierarchical composition.

At the conference, I met:
- [Ron Parr](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/) whose recent paper on [policy caches](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/nemecek21a.html) was an inspiration for further investigating bounds on the optimal value function in compositional RL (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09676) for a relevant pre-print). I also really enjoyed his work on [radial-basis value functions](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16828).

- [Matheus Centa](https://mmcenta.github.io/) and several others from his group at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en). We had a great time discussing ideas and I'm looking forward to their future work. The paper he presented at AAAI can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09882). It's a great read and the fundamental ideas are quite related to my own work.

- [Sam Lobel](https://samlobel.github.io/) who, with collaborators, (a) found a very fundamental problem with policy networks in deep RL, and (b) proposed a promising solution to this problem. I highly recommend reading the paper, which can be found [here](https://samlobel.github.io/files/QFunctionalsAAAI.pdf).

During the poster session, I also met:
- [Sreehari Rammohan](https://sreeharirammohan.com/) who is working with Sam Lobel (above) at Brown University. I'm looking forward to seeing his future work and collaborating with him in the future.
- Weiye Zhao (Carnegie Mellon University) who I can thank for the photo above, taken during the interactive poster session.
- and many others! (Feel free to reach out if we met so that I can add you to this list!)
