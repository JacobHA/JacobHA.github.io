tl;dr: 
In Dr. Kiril Streletzky's lab I analyzed experimental microgel data to study their temperature-dependent volume phase transition. With Dr. Miron Kaufman, I studied a new statistical mechanical model that explicitly accounts for polymeric crosslinking.

## The Story:
At my undergraduate institute, Cleveland State University (CSU) I took interest in the physics of microgels. I am interested in the thermodynamics of microgels, and the mechanics of their crosslinking. I started research in this area once I joined in Fall 2017 and gained more experience in the soft-matter Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at CSU.


Specifically, Dr. Streletzky's ([website][kiril-website]) lab used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to study the shape of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) microgels in suspension. I learned to analyze optical data and extract physical parameters (size vs. temperature) and intrinsic thermodynamic properties from Flory-Huggins (FH) theory.

Under the supervision of Dr. Miron Kaufman, I undertook a study of the statistical mechanics of crosslinked microgels. This analysis was based on [work][miron-work] motivated by the crosslinker dependency that was experimentally observed in Dr. Kiril Streletzky's lab.

## The Results:
- CSU and Kent State poster sessions [1][csu-poster], as a part of the soft-matter REU cohort.
- Presented several other posters, including: 2019 APS March Meeting ([2][kiril-poster], [3][miron-poster]).
- Published paper in [Macromolecules (2020)][paper-link].
- The mystery of the different crosslinking density regimes is still being [investigated][sam-paper]!

## The Details:
- HPC Microgels
- Flory-Rehner / Flory-Huggins theory
- Crosslink density
