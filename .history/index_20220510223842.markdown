and some text that is below the image (without an obnoxious number of <br /> tags).

The purpose of this website is to post blogs and tutorials on various topics related to physics, mathematics, and machine learning - as well as other topics that I find interesting.

I hope to use this website as a resource for explaining my research and some of my Github repositories.
