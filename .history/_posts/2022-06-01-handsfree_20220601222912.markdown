title:  "HandsFree: Manipulating 3D Files by Hand Gestures"

I have been working (on and off for the past year) on interfacing with 3D objects (files like *.stl, *.obj, etc.) through hand gestures. I realize the name for the project is a bit ironic! The point is to use your hands in "real life" rather than through the mouse to manipulate 3D objects in a more "natural" way.

I think this project was unconsciously inspired by a video released some time ago by [SpaceX][spacex-video]. However, their demo involves the use of some extra add-on motion sensors. I want to enable the same interactivity with the bare bones: a simple built-in laptop camera. This makes the problem substantially more difficult, because with just a camera we can only see a 2D representation of the scene (our hands). (This can be slightly bypassed by more advanced pose estimation, and with using infrared sensors, included on some laptops - but I want to keep it as basic as possible so that there are no hardware limitations.)



The code in [this repository][ddls-repo] is used to read in the optical data, perform the structure factor calculations, and generate a 3D object (cylinder, oblate spheroid, or prolate spheroid) based on the fitted parameters. Then, the object is visualized in an interactive html file, c.f. [this page][ddls-html], or click on the image below.
