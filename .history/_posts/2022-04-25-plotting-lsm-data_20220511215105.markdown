In this (first) post, I will be showing how to visualize the data from the proprietary [Zeiss][zeiss-homepage] LSM (microscopy) data format.

First, we need MATLAB to manipulate the file, using the bfopen function from bio-formats.
Then we save it after properly slicing away the multiple channels into two distinct arrays.
These files are opened in Python, where k3d and [vedo (a most recommended visualization toolkit!)][vedo-homepage] are used to visualize the data.

Check out the MATLAB/Python [repository][lsm-repo] for more details on how the visualization is done.

Click [here][lsm-htmlfile] to enter the interactive 2-channel model. Use the dropdown menu to toggle 
visibility of the two channels, and alter the minimum thresholds (vmin).

Please file all bugs/feature requests at [repo][lsm-repo].
