I have always been interested in the sciences and mathematics. My self-teaching journey began as a fun challenge in middle school. 
â€‹
I attended high school and college simultaneously. After obtaining my A.S. at Lorain County Community College, I attended Cleveland State University where I began my academic research career.

Today, I have many interests including statistical physics, thermodynamics, biophysics, superconductivity, polymers, electromagnetism, graph theory, and applications of group theory to physics and chemistry.

I have recently begun my PhD studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where I have served as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate physics labs and introductory physics discussions. 

My current research efforts are focused on the connection between reinforcement learning and physics.
