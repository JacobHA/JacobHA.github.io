Néel Institute Laboratory Research Student

During the summer of 2019, I travelled to Grenoble, France. There, I visited the Néel Institute and performed research under the supervision of Clemens Winkelmann ([website][clemens-website], [publications][clemens-pubs]) and Hervé Courtois ([website][herve-website], [publications][herve-pubs]) in their QUEST - QuNES department. Among an international team, I assembled an apparatus which allows for quick experimentation of nanodevices at liquid Helium temperature (4K) in a controllable magnetic field. The nanodevice I studied was a SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device), fabricated in-house by visiting researcher and collaborator Anjan Gupta ([website][anjan-website]).

​
Doctoral student Danial Majidi ([website][danial-website], [publications][danial-pubs]) mentored me and showed me the basics of the cryostat dilution fridge that he uses. This homemade "sionludi" fridge is able to cool samples down to 50mK. I helped to transfer liquid Helium to the cryostat in order to keep the samples cold.

​
I presented my results from this research experience at the 2019 OSAPS meeting in Flint, MI. You can see the poster [here][poster-link].
