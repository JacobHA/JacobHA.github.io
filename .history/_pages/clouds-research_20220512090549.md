tl;dr: 
Under supervision of Dr. Thijs Heus I worked on a computational model for their microphysics model of precipitation formation in the atmosphere. 

## The Story:
During my last year at my undergraduate institute, Cleveland State University (CSU), I took up a computational physics project, where I was tasked with programming and debugging microphysics calculations. This was my first time using C++ and CUDA, and I learned a lot about the power of GPU programming.


Specifically, Dr. Streletzky's ([website][kiril-website]) lab used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to study the shape of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) microgels in suspension. I learned to analyze optical data and extract physical parameters (size vs. temperature) and intrinsic thermodynamic properties from Flory-Huggins (FH) theory.

Under the supervision of Dr. Miron Kaufman, I undertook a study of the statistical mechanics of crosslinked microgels. This analysis was based on [work][miron-work] motivated by the crosslinker dependency that was experimentally observed in Dr. Kiril Streletzky's lab.

## The Results:
- CSU and Kent State poster sessions [1][csu-poster], as a part of the soft-matter REU cohort.
- Presented several posters: 2019 APS March Meeting ([2][kiril-poster], [3][miron-poster]).
- Published paper in [Macromolecules (2020)][paper-link].
- The mystery of the different crosslinking density regimes is still being [investigated][sam-paper]!

## The Details:
- HPC Microgels
- Flory-Rehner / Flory-Huggins theory
- Crosslink density
