tl;dr: 
Under supervision of Dr. Thijs Heus I worked on a computational model for their microphysics model of precipitation formation in the atmosphere. 

## The Story:
During my last year at my undergraduate institute, Cleveland State University (CSU), I took up a computational physics project, where I was tasked with programming and debugging microphysics calculations for microHH: a numerical Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) for modeling turbulent flow in the atmosphere. This was my first time using C++ and CUDA, and I learned a lot about the power of GPU programming. The project is still active and has its own [website][microhh-site] (also hosted by GitHub!).

While working on this large-scale collaborative [project][repo-link], I learned about patiently debugging code, and carefully pushing changes to GitHub.

## The Results:
- Gained familiarity with C++ and CUDA.
- Learned the basics of Git and GitHub. 
- Shortly after leaving CSU, the project was finished by another researcher on the team. The microphysics (C++ and CUDA) codes are now in use, and available on the [GitHub repository][repo-link].

## The Details:
- CUDA / GPU computing
- Microphysics of precipitation
