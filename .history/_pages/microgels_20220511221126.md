tl;dr: 
In Dr. Kiril Streletzky's lab I analyzed experimental microgel data to study their temperature-dependent volume phase transition. With Dr. Miron Kaufman, I studied a new statistical mechanical model that explicitly accounts for polymeric crosslinking.

## The Details:

- Flory-Rehner theory
- Crosslink density
