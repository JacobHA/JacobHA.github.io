tl;dr: 
In Dr. Kiril Streletzky's lab I analyzed experimental microgel data to study their temperature-dependent volume phase transition. With Dr. Miron Kaufman, I studied a new statistical mechanical model that explicitly accounts for polymeric crosslinking.

## The Story:
At my undergraduate institute, Cleveland State University (CSU) I took interest in the physics of microgels. I am interested in the thermodynamics of microgels, and the mechanics of their crosslinking. 

## The Results:
- Published paper in [Macromolecules (2020)][paper-link].
- Presented several posters: APS March Meeting (2019) and CSU poster sessions
- The mystery of crosslinking density regimes is still being [investigated][sam-paper]!

## The Details:
- HPC Microgels
- Flory-Rehner theory
- Crosslink density
