## Current Research
Since joining UMass Boston in Fall 2020, I have been working with Rahul Kulkarni ([website][rahul-website]).

I am currently working on Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically its applications and connections to physics.

## Past Research
- In summer of 2019, I visited the Neel Institute in France to work on superconductivity. Click [here][neel-link] to see more details.
