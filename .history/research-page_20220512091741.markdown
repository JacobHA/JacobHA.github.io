## Current Research
Since joining UMass Boston in Fall 2020, I have been working with Dr. Rahul Kulkarni ([website][rahul-website]).

I am currently working on Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically its applications and connections to physics.

## Past Research
- ["Cloud Computing"][clouds-link]
-- From fall 2020 to spring 2021 (my last year at CSU) I worked on a computational atmospheric model, used to study cloud formation and resulting weather patterns.

- [SQUIDs in Magnetic Fields][neel-link]
-- In summer of 2019, I visited the Neel Institute in France to work on superconductivity. 

- [Tunable Microgels][microgels-link]
-- During my time at Cleveland State University (fall 2017 - spring 2020), I worked on modeling and analyzing thermoresponsive microgels.
