# Jacob Adamczyk's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website!

The purpose of this website is to post blogs and tutorials on various topics related to physics, mathematics, and machine learning - as well as other topics that I find interesting.

I further hope to use this website as a resource for explaining my research and Github repositories.

P.S.:
