Annealing the discount factor has picked up popularity. Some work commenting on this includes: Dota 2, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19452, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02011. It potentially hints that the real objective of interest is that of average-reward maximization. (At large enough discount factors, the optimal policy is shared, so the schedule can lead to a good proxy and may be thought of as a curriculum.)
