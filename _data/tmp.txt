In this work, with Tharon Holdsworth and Professor Girish S. Agarwal, we exploited properties of sech pulses to develop a pulse sequence capable of saturating the Cram√©r-Rao bound. This allows for the most precise measurements of atomic resonance frequencies.</p>

        <p>I was invited to give a guest lecture at UMass Boston's new AI4ALL class. I gave an introduction to RL including discussions of exploration-exploitation, reward hacking, and policy improvement. The students developed custom environments related to real-world problems of their interest, and deployed RL algorithms to understand how agents learn and act. I had a great time teaching and the students did a tremendous job! I think such courses are important for increasing diversity in the field while giving students more tools for their future careers. </p>
