I have always been interested in the sciences and mathematics. My self-teaching journey began as a fun challenge in middle school when I learned some introductory physics and algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus. I then attended high school and college concurrently. After obtaining my A.S. at Lorain County Community College, I studied at Cleveland State University where I began my academic research career and earned a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics in spring of 2020.

I have recently begun my graduate studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where I have served as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate physics labs and introductory physics discussions. I am now a full-time Research Assistant under the advisory of Dr. Rahul V. Kulkarni.

Today, I have many wide-ranging interests including [reinforcement learning][research-page], statistical physics, [thermodynamics][poly-page], biophysics, [superconductivity][neel-page], [polymer physics][poly-page], graph theory, and applications of group theory to machine learning, physics and chemistry.

My current research efforts are focused on the connection between reinforcement learning and physics. You can read more about my past and current research [here][research-page].
