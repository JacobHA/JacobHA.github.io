## Current Research
Since joining UMass Boston in Fall 2020, I have been working with Dr. Rahul Kulkarni ([website][rahul-website]). Under his guidance, I have learned about Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), large deviations theory (LDT), and reinforcement learning (RL).

I am currently working on Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically its applications and connections to physics.
I have studied different forms of RL (standard vs. maximum entropy; average reward vs. discounted) in my research and my current goal is to understand how RL can generally be made more efficient in practice. For a recent (March 2022) talk at the APS March Meeting take a look [at this video][yt-link].

My research includes:
- Using prior knowledge of primitive behaviors to quickly learn more complex behaviors
    - Humans learn many disjoint tasks, but are able to combine them at will. For instance, we can extend our empty hand; and we also can grasp a ball. With minimal effort, we combine these skills by handing that ball to someone.
- Making agents which are able to adapt to new contexts (new dynamics, new rewards)
    - Change in dynamics: Humans use prior knowledge to solve unseen tasks easily. When we get a new pair of socks (new texture, color, we can still put them on our feet immediately, without having to try to do so several times.
    - Change in rewards: Humans can also adapt to changes in the goal of certain problems. Supposing we know how to place a cup of coffee at a certain point on a table, we can immediately place the cup elsewhere.
- Devising new algorithms based on insights from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
    - Markov chains, a fundamental ingredient of reinforcement learning, are a frequently used tool in statistical mechanics. Our group is studying ways of combining statistical mechanics with the reinforcement learning problem to create novel algorithms: which we hope will reduce the sample and time complexity of current algorithms.


## Past Research
- ["Cloud Computing"][clouds-link]
-- From fall 2019 to spring 2020 (my last year at CSU) I worked on a computational atmospheric model, used to study cloud formation and resulting weather patterns.

- [SQUIDs in Magnetic Fields][neel-link]
-- In summer of 2019, I visited the Neel Institute in France to work on superconductivity. 

- [Tunable Microgels][microgels-link]
-- During my time at Cleveland State University (fall 2017 - spring 2020), I worked on modeling and analyzing thermoresponsive microgels.
