On this page, I'll list some recent (2022+) and upcoming talks with some relevant materials (slides or video).

## 2024:
- The course I am teaching ("Deep Learning: Theory and Applications") has an associated github repo with code and my notes: [repo link][deep-learning]


## 2023
- UAI-2023: [Pending...]

- AAAI-2023: [Youtube Link][yt-link-aaai]

- APS March Meeting 2023: [Pending...]

- Physics Graduate Club: After March meeting, I'll be giving a mini-talk on the use of machine learning (and more specifically RL) in physics. One important source for this talk will be the work of [Kyle Mills](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bj4wnLYAAAAJ&hl=en). Additionally, [this work](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v145/gispen22a.html) by Gispen and Lamacraft will be of use. [Pending...]

## 2022
- APS March Meeting 2022: [Youtube Link][yt-link]

- Applied Physics PhD Oral Qualifying Exam: [slides][slides-link]

- Physics Graduate Club: (based on similar ideas presented in ["The Mathematical Mechanic"][amzn-link] by Mark Levi)
